// create a class that represents an aircraft
// There are 2 types of aircrafts: F16 and F35
// Both aircrafts should keep track of their ammunition
// All aircrafts should be created with an empty ammo storage

import { urlToHttpOptions } from "url";

// It should use all the ammo (set it to 0) and it should return the damage it causes
// damage is calculated by multiplying the base damage by the ammunition

// It should take a number as parameter that represents the ammunition coming from a station
// Increase the ammo of the aircraft by the right amount
// It can't have more ammo than the parameter value or the max ammo of the aircraft
// It should return the remaining (unused) ammo
// Eg. Filling an empty F35 with 300 would completely fill the storage of the aircraft and would return the remaining 288 

// getType(): It should return the type of the aircraft as a string
// getStatus(): It should return a string like: Type F35, Ammo: 10, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 500
// It should return if the aircraft is priority in the ammo fill queue. It's true for F35 and false for F16
