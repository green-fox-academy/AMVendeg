// Animal
// It must have ownerName and stores it's health's state isHealthy (true or false) and a healCost.
// It must have a method named heal(), that sets the isHealthy field's status to true
// It must have a method named isAdoptable that returns a boolean value 
// whether it can be adopted or not - an animal can be adopted if it is healthy

// It must have a method named toString() that represents the Animal in the following format:
// <name> is not healthy (<heal cost>€), and not adoptable
// <name> is healthy, and adoptable
// The animal's name is the same as the class name by default, but it can be set trough constructor as well
