/* Shopping list
We are going to represent a shopping list by a list containing strings.

Create a list with the following items:
eggs, milk, fish, apples, bread and chicken
Create an application which prints out the answers to the following questions:
Do we have milk in the shopping list? (yes/no)
Do we have bananas in the shopping list? (yes/no)
The full output of your main method should be the following:

yes
no 
*/

let shoppingList: string [] = ['eggs', 'milk', 'fish', 'apples', 'bread', 'chicken'];

// Do we have milk in the shopping list? (yes/no)
for (let i: number = 0; i <= shoppingList.length; i++) {
    if (shoppingList[i] === 'milk') {
        console.log("Yes, there is milk on the shoppingList");
    
    }
}

// is there product on the given list
function checkList(list: string[], product: string): boolean {
    return list.includes(product);
}
console.log(checkList(shoppingList, 'milk'));
console.log(checkList(shoppingList, 'banana'));
